Aldrin is an open source modular music sequencer/tracker for the GNU/Linux operating system. It features a flexible audio routing system commonly found in expensive audio software, enabling you to mix, split, mutilate and modify audio signals emitted by software synthesizers and samples.

Aldrin is no longer maintained and superseded by [Jacker](http://bitbucket.org/paniq/jacker/), a MIDI Tracker for JACK.
